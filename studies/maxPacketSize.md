For performant transmission of UDP packets over the internet, it's important to consider the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of the networks the packets will traverse. The MTU is the largest size a given packet or frame can be for transmission over a network. The typical MTU size for Ethernet is 1500 bytes, but the actual path MTU (the smallest MTU along the path between the sender and receiver) may vary, especially over the internet.

To avoid fragmentation (where larger packets are broken down into smaller ones by the network, which can lead to inefficiency and packet loss), it's generally advised to keep UDP payloads under the standard Ethernet MTU of 1500 bytes. However, you also need to account for the overhead introduced by the IP and UDP headers:

- **IP Header**: Typically 20 bytes for IPv4 without options (up to 60 bytes) and 40 bytes for IPv6.
- **UDP Header**: 8 bytes.

So, for IPv4, to avoid fragmentation, you would subtract the size of the IP header and UDP header from the MTU:

```
1500 bytes (Ethernet MTU) - 20 bytes (IP header) - 8 bytes (UDP header) = 1472 bytes
```

Thus, a safe payload size for UDP packets to avoid fragmentation over the internet would be **1472 bytes** for IPv4.

For IPv6, considering the larger header size:

```
1500 bytes (Ethernet MTU) - 40 bytes (IPv6 header) - 8 bytes (UDP header) = 1452 bytes
```

So, for IPv6, a safe payload size would be **1452 bytes**.

### Important Considerations

- **Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD)**: Ideally, applications should use PMTUD to discover the path MTU and adjust packet sizes accordingly. However, PMTUD can be unreliable in some environments due to ICMP messages being filtered by firewalls.
- **Conservative Sizing**: If you cannot reliably use PMTUD or if your application is highly sensitive to packet loss, you might choose a more conservative packet size, like 1280 bytes, which is the minimum MTU size that IPv6 networks are required to support.
- **Application Requirements**: The optimal UDP packet size also depends on your application's requirements for latency, throughput, and its tolerance for packet loss. For real-time applications (e.g., VoIP or gaming), smaller packets might be preferred to minimize latency, even if this means a slightly lower efficiency.
- **Testing**: It's beneficial to perform real-world tests under various network conditions to find the optimal packet size for your specific use case.

Remember, the goal is to maximize efficiency by minimizing fragmentation while also considering the specific needs and tolerance of your application.
